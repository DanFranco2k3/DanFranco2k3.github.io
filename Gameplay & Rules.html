			  <div class="title"><h4>Checkmate</h4></div>
			  <p>Check occurs when you or your opponent’s king is under attack and threatened to be captured by another piece. When this happens, the king must move, or the piece attacking the king must be captured. If the player cannot move out of danger and away from check, this is considered checkmate, and the game is over.</p>

				  <h4>En Passant</h4>
				  </div>
			  <p>In chess, en passant (French: [ɑ̃ paˈsɑ̃], lit. "in passing") describes a capture of an enemy pawn on an adjacent file that has just made an initial two-square advance. The capturing pawn moves to the square that the enemy pawn passed over, as if the enemy pawn had advanced only one square. The rule ensures that a pawn cannot use its two-square move to safely skip past an enemy pawn.</p>

			  <div class="title"><h4>Castling</h4></div>
			  <p>Castling is a move in chess. It consists of moving the king two squares toward a rook on the same rank and then moving the rook to the square that the king passed over. Castling is permitted only if neither the king nor the rook has previously moved; the squares between the king and the rook are vacant; and the king does not leave, cross over, or finish on a square attacked by an enemy piece. Castling is the only move in chess in which two pieces are moved at once. Castling is permitted provided all of the following conditions are met:<br><br>
				  1.) Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved.<br>
				  2.) There are no pieces between the king and the rook.<br>
				  3.) The king is not currently in check.<br>
				  4.) The king does not pass through or finish on a square that is attacked by an enemy piece.<br>
				  Conditions 3 and 4 can be summarized by the mnemonic: A player may not castle out of, through, or into check.</p>

				  <div class="title"><h4>Draws</h4></div>
				  </div>
			  <p>A draw occurs in chess when neither player wins nor loses—the game ends in a tie. Either of the two players can ask for a draw, and after the game is tied, each player wins half a point. Draws are more common among higher-rated players, but even if you're still a beginner or intermediate player, you should know all the drawing rules so no one catches you by surprise.<br><br> According to the FIDE rules, there are five different scenarios where a game can end in a draw. In most cases, one player has to propose or claim a tie, but in some specific situations, an arbiter may decide to end the game and claim a draw.</p>

			  <div class="title">
				  <h4>Pawn Promotion</h4>
				  <p>Pawn promotion occurs when a pawn reaches the farthest rank from its original square—the eighth rank for White and first rank for Black. When this happens, the player can replace the pawn for a queen, a rook, a bishop, or a knight. Most of the time, players promote a pawn to a queen, which is popularly known as "queening the pawn." After one player promotes a pawn, the other player has to move (unless they are checkmated, of course).</p>
